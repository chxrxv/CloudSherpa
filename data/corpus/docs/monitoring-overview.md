Cloud Monitoring collects, stores, and analyzes metric data to help you
understand the behavior, health, and performance of your applications and
Google Cloud services. Cloud Monitoring automatically collects performance
metrics for most Google Cloud services.
You can also collect Prometheus metrics by using
Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus, or install the
Ops Agent on your Compute Engine virtual machines (VMs) to
collect metrics and logs from your applications and third-party software.

With Cloud Monitoring alerting, testing, and visualization services, you can
track service load and performance, verify website responsiveness, and monitor
the health of your App Hub applications. You can access and
manage most Cloud Monitoring services by using the Google Cloud console, the
Cloud Monitoring API, the Google Cloud CLI, or
Terraform.

## Cloud Monitoring services

Cloud Monitoring provides different services that you can use
to understand the health and performance of your applications and of the
other Google Cloud services that you use.

### Alerts and notifications in Cloud Monitoring

To be notified when the value of a performance metric meets criteria that you
define, create an alerting policy. The alerting policy
includes the list of people or groups who are to receive notifications.
Monitoring supports
common notification channels,
including email, Cloud Mobile App, and services such as PagerDuty or Slack.
For example, you might create an alerting policy so that you are notified
when the CPU utilization of a VM exceeds 80%.

Each notification includes relevant information about a failure, and it
includes a link to an alert. An *alert* is a persistent record
that stores information that you can use to troubleshoot the failure. Typically,
a record lists the status of the alert, links to logs, a chart of the
recorded metric data, labels, and duration.

The alerting service is integrated with many Google Cloud services. When these
integrations exist, you might see a panel that lists recommended alerts, or
you might see a button on a chart that lets you create an alerting policy.
In both cases, the alerting policies are preconfigured;
you only specify the list of people or groups to be notified.

You can create and manage alerting policies by using the Google Cloud console,
the Cloud Monitoring API, the Google Cloud CLI, or Terraform.

### Proactive monitoring and validation

To test the availability, consistency, and performance of your services,
applications, web pages, and APIs, create
synthetic monitors. For example,
you can probe HTTP, HTTPS, and TCP endpoints for responsiveness with
uptime checks, and then get notified when an
endpoint fails to respond. You can also create a
broken-link checker to crawl a web page and then
notify you when broken links are detected.

You can create and manage synthetic monitors by using the Google Cloud console,
the Cloud Monitoring API, the Google Cloud CLI, or Terraform.

### Data visualization

As you instantiate Google Cloud resources or register applications with
App Hub, the dashboard service automatically creates
Google Cloud-managed dashboards.
These dashboards show curated information that helps you understand
the health of your resources and applications.
For example, for an App Hub application, dashboards are created for
the application and for each of its services and workloads.
These dashboards show information like an application's log
or metric data, and the number of open alerts.

The dashboards created by Google Cloud might provide you enough information
to complete an investigation. However, they might not provide the exact data
you need to see trends, identify outliers, or view other
details about your data. To complete these tasks, you can use the
dashboard and charting services:

- To control what data you view and the display format for that data,
  create a custom dashboard. For example,
  you might import a Grafana dashboard or
  install a dashboard from a template.

  Your custom dashboards can display the following:

  - Charts and tables that show metric data
  - Log data and error groups
  - Charts for alerting policies
  - Information about alerts
  - Text
  - Events, such as a reboot or a crash, that affect
    the operation of a system.

  You can create and manage dashboards by using
  the Google Cloud console or the
  API.
- The chart service, Metrics Explorer,
  lets you quickly visualize and explore time-series data. The chart settings
  let you compare current data to previous data, display outliers and
  percentiles, and display multiple metrics. You can also
  save charts to a custom dashboard.

### Data collection and storage

Cloud Monitoring collects and stores the following types of metric data:

- System metrics generated by Google Cloud services.
  These metrics provide information about how a service is operating.

- System and application metrics that the
  Ops Agent collects about system resources and
  applications
  running on Compute Engine instances. You can configure the Ops Agent
  to collect metrics from third-party plugins such
  as Apache or Nginx web servers, or MongoDB or PostgreSQL databases.

- User-defined metrics that are created by
  using the Cloud Monitoring API or by using a
  library such as OpenTelemetry.
- External metrics that are defined by some open source
  libraries or third-party providers.
- Prometheus metrics that are collected by
  Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus,
  or by using the Ops Agent and the
  Prometheus receiver or the
  OTLP receiver.

- Log-based metrics that record numeric information about
  the logs written to Cloud Logging.
  Google-defined log-based metrics include
  counts of the errors that your service detects and the total
  number of log entries received by your Google Cloud project.
  You can also define log-based metrics.

## Query languages for Cloud Monitoring

When you create an alerting policy or a chart, you must
provide a query that describes the data that you want to monitor or chart:

- Google Cloud console: You can build your query by making selections from menus,
  or you can write a query. Query editors are available for
  the Prometheus Query Language (PromQL). The query editor
  provides syntax checks and suggestions. You can also
  write a Monitoring filter expression.
- Cloud Monitoring API: The API supports
  Prometheus Query Language (PromQL)
  and Monitoring filter expressions.

## Monitor metrics for multiple Google Cloud projects

To view and monitor the time-series data for multiple
Google Cloud projects and AWS accounts through a single interface,
configure a multi-project metrics scope.

By default, Cloud Monitoring pages in the Google Cloud console provide
access only to the time series stored in the *scoping project*. The
scoping project is the project that you selected with the
Google Cloud console project picker. The scoping project
stores the alerts, synthetic monitors, and
dashboards
that you configure.

The scoping project also hosts a metrics scope.
The *metrics scope* defines the projects and accounts whose metrics are
visible to the scoping project. You can configure the metrics scope
to include time-series data from other Google Cloud projects and from
AWS accounts. For information about how to modify a metrics scope, see
Configure a metrics scope for multiple projects.

## Cloud Monitoring data model

This section introduces the Cloud Monitoring data model:

- A *metric type* describes something that is
  measured. Examples of metric types include a VM's CPU utilization and the
  percentage of a disk that is used.
- A *time series* is a data structure that contains time-stamped measurements
  of a metric and information about the source and
  meaning of those measurements.

Here are some details about what a time series contains:

- The `points` array contains the time-stamped measurements.

  The following is an example of a `points` array with two values:

  ```
    "points": [
      {
        "interval": {
          "startTime": "2020-07-27T20:20:21.597143Z",
          "endTime": "2020-07-27T20:20:21.597143Z"
        },
        "value": {
          "doubleValue": 0.473005
        }
      },
      {
        "interval": {
          "startTime": "2020-07-27T20:19:21.597239Z",
          "endTime": "2020-07-27T20:19:21.597239Z"
        },
        "value": {
          "doubleValue": 0.473025
        }
      },
    ],
  ```

  To understand the meaning of a value, you need to refer to the other data
  included in the time series and to the definitions of that data.
- The `resource` field describes the hardware or software component
  that is being monitored. In Cloud Monitoring, the hardware or software
  component is referred to as the *monitored resource*.
  Examples of monitored resources include Compute Engine
  instances and App Engine applications. For a list of
  monitored resources, see the Monitored resource list.

  The following is an example of a `resource` field:

  ```
    "resource": {
      "type": "gce_instance",
      "labels": {
        "instance_id": "2708613220420473591",
        "zone": "us-east1-b",
        "project_id": "sampleproject"
      }
    }
  ```

  - The `type` field lists the monitored resource
    as a `gce_instance`, which indicates that
    these measurements are taken on a Compute Engine VM instance.
  - The `labels` field contains key-value pairs that provide additional
    information about the monitored resource. For a `gce_instance` type,
    the labels identify the VM instance that is being monitored.
- The `metric` field describes what is being measured.

  The following is an example of a `metric` field:

  ```
    "metric": {
      "labels": {
        "instance_name": "test"
      },
      "type": "compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/utilization"
    },
  ```

  - For Google Cloud services, the `type` field specifies the service and what
    is being monitored. In this example, the Compute Engine service is
    measuring the CPU utilization.
    When the `type` field begins with `custom` or `external`, the metric is
    either a custom metric or one defined by a third party.
  - The `labels` field contains key-value pairs that provide additional
    information about the measurement. These labels are defined as part of
    the `MetricDescriptor`, which is a data structure that
    defines the attributes of the measured data.
    The `MetricDescriptor` for the metric
    `compute.googleapis.com/instance/cpu/utilization`
    includes the label `instance_name`.
- The `metricKind` field describes the relationship between
  adjacent measurements within a time series:

  - `GAUGE` metrics store the value of the thing being
    measured at a given moment in time—for example, an hourly
    temperature record.
  - `CUMULATIVE` metrics store the accumulated value of the thing being
    measured at a given moment in time—for example, an odometer in a
    vehicle.
  - `DELTA` metrics store the change in the value of the thing being
    measured over a specified period—for example, a stock
    summary that shows the stock's gains or losses.
- The `valueType` field describes the data type for the
  measurement: `INT64`, `DOUBLE`, `BOOL`, `STRING`, or
  `DISTRIBUTION`.

Cloud Monitoring writes one time series for each combination of
resource and metric label values. You can use these labels to group and to
filter time series.
For example, when a Google Cloud project contains multiple
Compute Engine VM instances, the CPU utilization for each VM instance
is a unique time series. Here are a few of the ways that you can display this
data:

- You can show the CPU utilization of every VM instance.
- You can show the CPU utilization for a specific VM instance by
  filtering the time series for a single value of the `instance_id` label.
- You can group the VM instances by the `machine_type` label,
  and then display the average CPU utilization. The following screenshot
  illustrates a chart with this configuration:
